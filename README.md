# Women Empowerment Project

CIVIL-465 Research Project

## Description

The concept of empowerment is quite well known and studied but the quantitative analysis of this concept remains complex. However, measurement approaches to women’s empowerment could help us learn about the impact of development interventions that are working towards women’s empowerment: this would be in the form of a numerical value for empowerment that could be generalized to the entire population under analysis. This project is about finding quantitative indicators that can be used to understand, calculate and predict women’s empowerment according to different cultures and conditions of living.
